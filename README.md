`splitTickDistance` controls whether you want to have a separate tick distance from your render distance

`tickDistance` controls your normal tick distance if `splitTickDistance` is enabled

`dynamicTickDistance` controls whether the tick distance should fluctuate between `tickDistance` and `minTickDistance` depending on server MSPT

`minTickDistance` controls the minimum value the tick distance will be if `dynamicTickDistance
 is enabled

`dynamicRenderDistance` controls whether the render distance should fluctuate between `minRenderDistance` and `maxRenderDistance` depending on server MSPT

`minRenderDistance` controls the minimum render distance when `dynamicRenderDistance` is enabled
